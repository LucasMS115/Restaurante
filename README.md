# Restaurante

Running here: https://restaurante-sintese.netlify.app/#/

<p>SPA template for a restaurant with a reservation, login and adm systems using Node.js, Postgresql, Sequelize and React.js</p>

<p>Security features have not yet been implemented, the adm and reserves systems might need some upgrades as well :)</p>

<p>To run the backend locally use a DB on Postgresql, the connection is done in "./src/config/databese.js", run  " ... sequelize db:migrate" to create the tables.</p>

# Scripts:
<p>server -> run the back-end locally</p>
<p>client -> run the front-end</p>
<p>dev -> run both</p>
